# Excel-Challenge
Organization and analysis of Kickstarter campaigns to uncover any hidden trends using Excel.

<b> KickStarter Campaign Results Report: </b> https://github.com/poojanagrecha/excel-challenge/blob/main/Solutions/Report.docx
# Background
Over $2 billion has been raised using the massively successful crowdfunding service, Kickstarter, but not every project has found success. Of the more than 300,000 projects launched on Kickstarter, only a third have made it through the funding process with a positive outcome.

Getting funded on Kickstarter requires meeting or exceeding the project's initial goal, so many organizations spend months looking through past projects in an attempt to discover some trick for finding success. Organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects in order to uncover any hidden trends.
# Analysis
* Conditional formatting is applied to the state (based on successful, failed, cancelled, or live) and percent funded column.

* Created a pivot table that analyzed the initial worksheet to count how many campaigns were successful, failed, canceled, or are currently live per category.
